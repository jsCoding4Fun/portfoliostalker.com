Partially public C# Blazor project, to keep track of stocks and holdings.

Implemented using C# Blazor client-side application. PfsDevelUI contains all UI codes, but uses NUGET PortfolioStalker.Client to access PFS servers.
Some of additional codes, like accessing ext provider's to fetch market data are released.

PfsDevelUI itself should be enough to run application, connect servers and see bit how Blazor code works. This is very engineer UI, 
with just fast drag-and-drop components implementation. Done using excelent MudBlazor (free) component library.
